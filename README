 QUESTIONS: 
 What kinds of file lead to lots of compressions?
Files that have repeating characters naturally lead to a
increased need for compression due to the increased frequencies. This leads to an increase in time as the compression has more to do.
The more repeated information you have, the more information you need to compress, so it takes a longer time. 

What kind of files had little or no compression?
Files that have little or no compression are files that h dave majority distinct or unique characters. 
This means that the file has unique information that the compressor needs to retain, which leads to a reduction in how much
of the file is actually compressed. 

What happens when you try and compress a huffman code file?
There shouldn't be much of a difference in size. Upon another compression pass, since the frequencies should be
relatively the same, the compression wouldn't really accomplish much.
